# cyberhawk_turbine_challenge
An application written in PHP and HTML that visualises a unique spin on the classic FizzBuzz Challenge

## Installation

PHP 7.1.33 hosted on AWS EC2

## Usage

```php

for numbers in range 1 to 100 {
  for each number {
    if number == / of 3
      print "coating damage"
    if number == / of 5
      print "lightning strike"
    if number == / of 3 && 5
      print "coating damage and lightning strike"
  }
}

```

## MVP
- The script will be written in php
- The script will be rendered using html
- Use Github for version control
- Host script in AWS

## Nice to haves (future development) 
- Pulling the inspection data down in an Ajax call and processing the results in the browser
- Add a randomiser option where an event click will pick a number between 1 and 100 and render the results
- Pass through unit testing (TDD)
